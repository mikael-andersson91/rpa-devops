## Mission statement

Why are we here? What value does DevOps bring to RPA? Are we just combining buzzwords for the fun of it?

Have you and your team ever asked yourselves any of the following questions while working on an RPA project?

- Did you deploy the changes you worked on last week?
- When did we add this new feature to the robot?
- Why was this part of the process changed?
- Do the users have access to the latest features?
- Did anyone test the latest features?

By introducing tooling to aid in all steps of the Software Development Life Cycle, many of these questions can easily be answered by just looking at your source code repository! This page is intended to be a mix of reusable resources and examples to inspire you in building your CI pipelines.

## The Pipeline

At the core of everything comes the Delivery Pipeline.
